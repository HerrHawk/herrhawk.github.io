For the implementation of a vehicle model recognition, deep learning methods like CNNs are suitable. Such methods generally require large amounts of data. Since for the special case of the vehicle model recognition, hardly sufficient and current data sets are available, these would have to be collected laboriously. Synthesized training data can be a helpful tool to solve the problem of insufficient training data. With the help of real-time rendering engines, images can be generated in almost any variation and quantity in real-time. In this work, it will be examined to what extent such synthetic images are suitable for training CNNs for the classification of vehicle models. The problem of the domain gap, a divergence between real and synthetic data, which is associated with synthetic data, is addressed by the use of domain randomization in data generation and methods of domain adaptation in the training of the CNN. It is shown that by using simple yet effective domain adaptation methods in combination with synthetic images and few real images it is possible to train a vehicle model recognition mainly on synthetic data."}],socialSharings:[{id:"9dee4d77-96a0-4b31-9499-b992e08815d4",name:g,icon:h,url:i},{id:"c981d1fb-5c67-4803-9bb9-7fd80f084977",name:j,icon:k,url:l},{id:"31a85dbe-3361-44c3-8500-5d86acfc30a6",name:m,icon:n,url:o},{id:"2e4a86a7-5a87-4935-a87d-abb49cdbe33f",name:a,icon:b,url:p},{id:"24e7fd7f-8b70-4473-a80c-16bf565bd16a",name:q,icon:r,url:s},{id:"88857460-c167-4b61-ab9a-f8df88e15a2e",name:t,icon:u,url:v}]},{id:"260d1271-f1f2-4bc9-a5eb-05a89c8cccdc",title:"Fermentation Box",category:J,img:S,publishDate:c,tag:J,objectivesTitle:d,objectivesDetails:B,techTitle:e,detailsTitle:f,socialTitle:Q,projectImages:[{id:"02ed6452-5648-44c3-bf51-b55446afe39a",title:K,img:"\u002Fimages\u002Ffs2.jpg"},{id:"f9727af4-23fd-4238-b524-c32483aaf11a",title:K,img:S},{id:"dd9f5300-7315-44bb-bf71-1184e404c9ec",title:K,img:"\u002Fimages\u002Ffs5.jpg"}],technologies:["C",J,"Make","ATmega328P"],projectDetails:[{id:"98d143b4-9adf-4c9b-9700-b25252db1353",details:"The motivation behind Fermentation Station was to have an easy way of maintaining a controlled environment (meaning temperature and humidity).
